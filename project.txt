     - Article = 5 TFB  
     - Comment = 1 TFB  
     - Event Participation = 3 TFB  
   - *Redemption Options*:  
     - Digital gifts (games, books)  
     - Donate to charities  
     - Convert to fiat (via parental approval)  

3. *Safety & Compliance*  
   - COPPA/GDPR compliance (no personal data collection)  
   - Parental consent for crypto features

### *Step 2: Choose Tech Stack*
| Component | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|

### *Step 3: Development Phases*
#### *Phase 1: MVP (Basic Website)*
1. *Landing Page*  
   - Explain the concept ("News by Kids, Rewards in Crypto")  
   - Signup for early access (collect emails)  

2. *User Dashboard*  
   - Profile page (username, earned TFB)  
   - Submission form for articles/comments  

3. *Reward Tracking*  
   - Firebase DB to track off-chain TFB balances  

#### *Phase 2: Crypto Integration*
1. *Deploy TFB Token*  
   - Use *Thirdweb* to create an ERC-20 token on Polygon.  
   - Example contract: [Thirdweb Token Tool](https://thirdweb.com/)  

2. *Custodial Wallets*  
   - Integrate *Magic.Link* for seamless logins.  
   - Kids get an "invisible" wallet tied to their email.  

3. *Reward Distribution*  
   - Automate TFB payouts via *Thirdweb SDK* when kids submit content.  

#### *Phase 3: Redemption & Safety*
1. *Reward Shop*  
   - Exchange TFB for gift cards (Amazon, Roblox) via *Tremendous API*.  
   - Option to donate tokens to charities.  

2. *Parental Controls*  
   - Require parent email verification for withdrawals.
